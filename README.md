# DS4400-ML-Rain
A final project for Northeastern University's DS4400 Machine Learning and Data Mining Class. Using Kaggle's Australia Rain Dataset, we will hand write the code for different machine learning models in order to better learn the applications of, in our case, classification models and enhance our coding techniques when it comes to Machine Learning.
